The EntreprenHeurist Game by Paul Fisher and Mathew Thomas: The Baby Snakes

Description:
The EntreprenHeurist Game is an incremental game whose object is to earn as much currency (KitKats) as possible in a given amount of time. The game can be played as a classic single player incremental game, or as a real time adversarial game. A player earns currency each second from the properties (Algorithms) that they own. These properties must themselves be purchased and upgraded by spending currency. In single player mode the cost of the next property of each type increases by a constant factor after each purchase of each property of that type. In two player mode, the cost of a property is increased by a constant factor through the use of "penalties" by the second player, the adversary. The adversary gains one penalty to use after each purchase by the player and an additional penalty after every 20 seconds during which the player does not purchase a property. The goal of the adversary is to choose on which property to use each of its penalties in order to minimize the amount of currency the player can earn.


How to compile:
With transcrypt and python 3 installed and while in the game's directory:
$ transcrypt -b -m incremental.py

This game is written in python, using the python3-to-JavaScript compiler Transcrypt (http://www.transcrypt.org/)
To install transcrypt (provided you have python 3):
$ python -m pip install transcrypt


Transcrypt creates the necessary javascript files. Once these are written, the game needs the following to run:
__javascript__ //The directory containg the js files that will be used by the browser
incremental.html //named index.php in the uploaded submission
incremental.css
nim.png

Because the javascript code is generated by the compiler, it is not commented. All programmer comments are located in the python source code


How to run:
Open the file "incremental.html" in a browser of your choice, located in a directory with the above files and directories.

How to play:
On the home screen, enter a time, in seconds, for your game. The game will end after that amount of time, and you will be notified the total amount of currency that the player earned. This includes currency earned and then spent. If the game begins with time = 0, the game will be endless. This is preferable for casual play. The optimal strategy changes based on the time of the game. In a longer game, it may make sense to save up for more expensive properties and upgrades, whereas in a shorter game it may be better to by cheaper properties as soon as they are available.

Once you've decided on a time limit, click either the one player or two player button to start a new game. As the player, use the mouse to buy (develop) or upgrade (improve) your algorithms. The cost of each is displayed next to the button. The buttons have toottips to tell you the effect of purchasing that particualar property or upgrade. The counter in the top left tells you your current amoutn of currency and the time left on the game (if it is less than 10000 seconds.)

As the adversary, use the number keys ("1" - "8") to apply cost increases to the respective properties. Try to make it as inefficent as possible for the player to earn more income.
