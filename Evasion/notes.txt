Hunter
Check if when we build a wall, both prey and hunter are on same side

prey
move away from hunter
move to center of area we're enclosed
predict path of hunter, before and after one bounce


find the region on the same side of all walls as the prey, this is the area
available to the prey, we want to minimize it
delete walls that won't affect it at all, and also add walls that will
restrict it

check if hunter is in same region as prey, if so ,add walls, if not, delete
walls

DELETE WALLS THAT DONT MATTER ALWAYS

No point in creating a wall if in less than N timesteps, the prey cant get
to that wall

Calculate regions for each wall created, put in lookup table
