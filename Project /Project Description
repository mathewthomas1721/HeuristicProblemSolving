Incremental Game

Goal : Maximize total amount earned / Maximize current money

Description : N properties, each of which have a base cost and base income rate, cost multiplier for each property.

We want to build an incremental game where the goal of the player is to maximize the amount of profit they have earned by a certain time.
They will do this by purchasing up to n profit generating properties. Each property will have a base cost, base income rate, and a cost multiplier.
There will also be upgrades for purchase which will increase the income rate of certain properties (or all properties, as dictated by the upgrade).

The game will be playable by humans, where they manually buy properties and upgrades as they see fit. The game would also playable programmatically by receiving
an input of which properties and upgrades should be bought sequentially. The properties/upgrades would be purchased in that order as soon as the player has enough
money to pay for it.
