Rank artists by how soon they auction n paintings

Update rankings every round, based on how soon WE can get n paintings of that artist

Base our bids on those rankings

How?

THAT'S THE QUESTION

BASE STRATEGY

Bid 0 or 1 on every painting that isn't our top ranked

When it is our top ranked, assume we'll get all paintings for the same price = curr_money/n-number_we_have

ADDITIONAL STRATEGY

Increase our bid if someone else is also likely to bid on our first choice
